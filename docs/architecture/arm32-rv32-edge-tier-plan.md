# ARM32 + RV32 EDGE-Tier Architecture Expansion Plan

This document defines how Bharat-OS should add 32-bit architecture support without splitting into separate kernel personalities.

## Decision Summary

Bharat-OS will support five CPU families in two runtime tiers:

- **Tier 1 (Full Baseline / `full`):** `x86_64`, `arm64`, `riscv64`
- **Tier 2 (EDGE32 Compact Ports / `edge32`):** `arm32`, `riscv32`

arm32 and riscv32 are EDGE32 targets. In the current developer branch they must remain non-production runtime targets while trap/syscall paths are explicitly marked unsupported.

Tier 2 is first-class in product scope, but starts with a smaller mandatory feature envelope to avoid premature parity churn.

## Non-Negotiable Rule

Do not fork kernel semantics into a “64-bit OS” and a separate “32-bit special-case OS.”

Core kernel contracts must remain:

- XLEN-neutral
- page-table-model neutral
- interrupt-controller neutral
- cache/DMA coherency-model neutral
- capability format versioned where needed

Architecture backends may vary in feature richness, but not in core security and IPC semantics.

## Architecture Capability Matrix

Common code should key off declared architecture capabilities, not inferred pointer width assumptions.

### Proposed capability flags

- `ARCH_CAP_64BIT_VA`
- `ARCH_CAP_SMP`
- `ARCH_CAP_MMU_FULL`
- `ARCH_CAP_DMA_COHERENT`
- `ARCH_CAP_ADV_IRQ_ROUTING`
- `ARCH_CAP_USERSPACE_HIGHHALF`
- `ARCH_CAP_HW_CRC`
- `ARCH_CAP_SIMD_NET_CSUM`

### Tier baseline expectations

| Capability / Feature | Tier 1 (x86_64, arm64, riscv64) | Tier 2 (arm32, riscv32) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core capability syscall semantics | Required | Required |
| Endpoint IPC contract | Required | Required |
| Scheduler/fault model | Required | Required |
| SMP | Required | Optional initially (UP-first allowed) |
| Advanced IRQ affinity/routing | Preferred/required by platform | Optional initially |
| VM/aspace depth | Full model | Reduced model allowed |
| DMA/cache maintenance richness | Full model | Reduced model allowed |
| Userspace VA range | Large | Reduced bounds allowed |

## Implementation Guidance

### 1) Portability cleanup before new bring-up

Audit and normalize shared core/kernel/HAL code for 32/64-bit safety:

- address and size types (`uintptr_t`, `size_t`, `vaddr_t`, `paddr_t`)
- page-table entry abstractions
- PFN width assumptions
- syscall argument packing
- capability/object identifiers
- timeout/tick math
- bitmap and cpumask widths
- cache/DMA assumptions

### 2) Keep contracts stable, vary richness by capability

Must remain architecture-invariant:

- capability semantics
- syscall ABI contract
- endpoint/IPC semantics
- scheduler model
- fault contract
- driver/service isolation model

Allowed to vary by tier:

- page-table depth
- ASID space richness
- TLB invalidation sophistication
- MSI/MSI-X style routing support
- SIMD acceleration
- cache maintenance detail
- userspace VA size

### 3) Keep 32-bit HAL backends explicit

Avoid spreading `#ifdef` logic across 64-bit backends.

Use dedicated backend trees:

- `core/kernel/src/corecore/hal/arm32/...`
- `core/kernel/src/corecore/hal/riscv32/...`

Each backend should own its own:

- trap/exception entry
- MMU/PT implementation
- timer + interrupt controller integration
- cache/DMA operations
- boot path and board glue

### 4) Start with narrow reference platforms

Do not attempt broad architecture claims at initial merge.

- **ARM32 first target:** one MMU-capable Cortex-A class platform
- **RV32 first target:** one deterministic QEMU/SoC-style platform with known timer + interrupt + memory map

### 5) Recommended phase plan

1. **Phase 1 – Portability cleanup:** make common code XLEN-safe.
2. **Phase 2 – Capability matrix:** codify required vs optional arch features.
3. **Phase 3 – ARM32 bring-up:** minimal boot + trap + timer + IRQ + MMU + context switch.
4. **Phase 4 – RV32 bring-up:** same minimum on one reference platform.
5. **Phase 5 – EDGE tuning:** memory footprint, lean service set, and profile-level optimization.

## Repository Alignment Notes

The repository already documents full HAL paths for `x86_64`, `arm64`, and `riscv64`, and identifies EDGE targets (wearables, robotics, drones) as explicit product profiles. This plan extends that trajectory while containing complexity growth.

The QEMU ARM32 and RV32 reference targets now use MMU-Lite as their declared
memory model and remain UP-first. Their first address-space activation installs
private, supervisor-only identity mappings for the kernel RAM and required MMIO
windows before enabling TTBR0/SATP. User mappings may split those bootstrap
leaves only in their owning address space; they never receive user permission
on the kernel or device bootstrap windows.

Generated trap and CPU-context offsets are compiled with the target compiler
triple. This is required on EDGE32 so assembly consumes 32-bit `uintptr_t`
offsets rather than host-width offsets.

The plan also aligns with the existing statement that runtime maturity differs by architecture target, by making maturity and capability deltas explicit and testable.
