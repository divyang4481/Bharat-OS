# Context Switch and Syscall/Trap Gates

This document defines the current in-kernel context switch mechanism and syscall/trap gate contract, adapting our architecture to the multikernel Barrelfish/seL4 model.

## Syscall/Trap Gate Baseline

- Central trap frame model (`trap_frame_t`) with register argument ABI slots.
- Syscall number space (`syscall_id_t`) for privileged kernel operations:
  - thread create/destroy,
  - scheduler yield,
  - VMM map/unmap,
  - capability invoke hook,
  - endpoint create/send/receive,
  - capability delegation.
- Dispatcher (`syscall_dispatch`) with per-call parameter validation.
- Trap handler (`trap_handle`) with:
  - cause filtering,
  - user-mode privilege check,
  - return code propagation to ABI return register,
  - architecture-aware PC advance after syscall.
- Boot-time trap gate setup via `trap_init()` from `kernel_main`.

## Security Baseline Checks

- Reject non-user trap-originated syscall attempts.
- Reject unsupported syscall IDs with explicit `-ENOSYS`-style code.
- Validate user pointer range before writing syscall outputs.

## Register Save/Restore & FPU State

During a context switch, the kernel securely isolates task states:
- `cpu_context_t` stores architecture-local scalar state at native register
  width. Its layout is authoritative in C; every supported context-switch
  assembly implementation consumes build-generated `BH_CTX_*` offsets. This
  prevents 32-bit assembly from interpreting a 64-bit-slot C layout.
- General purpose registers are saved onto the thread's kernel stack within `trap_frame_t`.
- FPU and SIMD state saving is lazy; only swapped if the thread has used them.
- Address Space IDs (ASIDs) are switched, flushing only non-global TLB entries where ASIDs aren't supported.

## Context Switch Flow

    participant Sched as Scheduler

    App->>Trap: System Call (e.g. `svc`, `ecall`, `int 0x80`)
    Trap->>Trap: Save general purpose registers (trap_frame_t)
    Trap->>C_Handler: Call C handler
    C_Handler->>C_Handler: Privilege check & cause filter
    C_Handler->>Syscall: Dispatch syscall_id
    Syscall->>Syscall: Execute kernel action (e.g., capability check)
    Syscall-->>C_Handler: Return result (in ABI reg)
    C_Handler->>Sched: Optional: sched_yield() or context switch
    Sched-->>Trap: Restore next thread's state (ASID, SP, PC)
    Trap-->>App: Return to Userspace (sysret, eret)
```

## Deferred for Production

- Assembly entry stubs per architecture (x86_64 IDT/syscall entry, RISC-V `stvec`).
- Fine-grained capability policy enforcement in `cap_invoke` path.
- Full trap delegation verification and interrupt controller integration.

The generated CPU-context ABI closes only the structural C/assembly handoff.
Address-space activation must separately guarantee that kernel text, the
active kernel stack, exception vectors, and per-CPU state remain mapped until
the architecture transition commits; higher-half ARM and RISC-V mapping work
remains required before those targets are runtime-qualified.
