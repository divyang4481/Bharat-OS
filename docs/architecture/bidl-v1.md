# Bharat-OS IDL (BIDL) v1 Grammar (Current Implementation Profile)

> **Note:** The old path `tools/binterface/idl/bidlc.py` has been removed and replaced by `tools/bidl/bidlc.py`.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the **currently implemented BIDL v1 profile** used by the in-repo tooling (`tools/bidl/bidlc.py` and `tools/abi/check_idl_compat.py`).

It is intentionally narrower than the broader architectural language drafts in `docs/architecture/contracts/`.

Use this document when you need to know what parses and code-generates **today**.

---

## 2. Implementation Status (as of April 22, 2026)

Bharat-OS currently has multiple IDL-style syntaxes in `interface/idl/` (e.g., `service/message`, `package+struct`, `namespace/interface/method`).

Only the `service ... rpc ... message/struct ...` family is handled by the active Python tooling used for codegen/compat checks.

- `tools/bidl/bidlc.py` parses:
  - `service <qualified_name> = <service_id> { ... }`
  - `rpc <Method>(<Req>) -> <Resp>`
  - `message <Name> { ... }`
- `tools/abi/check_idl_compat.py` additionally accepts:
  - `service <qualified_name> { ... }` (implicit `id = 0`)
  - `struct <Name> { ... }` as an alias for `message`
  - `enum <Name> { ... }` with explicit integer assignments

### Practical guidance

If your `.bidl` must be consumed by **both** codegen and ABI compatibility checks, prefer this conservative subset:

1. `service <qualified_name> = <service_id> { ... }`
2. `rpc <Method>(<ReqType>) -> <RespType>`
3. `message <TypeName> { <field_type> <field_name>; }`
4. Avoid relying on parser support for attributes/annotations as semantic inputs (they are tolerated as text but not interpreted for generation).

---

## 3. Core Grammar (Implemented Subset)

### 3.1 Service

```idl
service <qualified_name> = <service_id> {
  // rpc definitions
}
```

- `qualified_name` allows letters, digits, underscore, and dot.
- `service_id` is an integer.

### 3.2 RPC Method

```idl
rpc <MethodName>(<RequestType>) -> <ResponseType> {
  // optional metadata lines (not consumed by codegen today)
}
```

- RPC order is ABI-relevant for the compatibility checker (append-only evolution).
- Dispatch codegen currently assigns opcodes incrementally in declaration order, starting at `1`.

### 3.3 Message / Struct

```idl
message <MessageName> {
  <type> <field_name>;
}
```

Compatibility tooling also accepts:

```idl
struct <MessageName> {
  <type> <field_name>;
}
```

Field order is ABI-relevant and must be append-only for non-breaking evolution.

### 3.4 Enum (compatibility checker)

```idl
enum <EnumName> {
  <NAME> = <int>;
}
```

Enum values must remain stable once published.

---

## 4. Data Types in the Current Code Generator

`bidlc.py` currently generates C for:

- `u32` → `uint32_t`
- `u64` → `uint64_t`
- `string<N>` → inline bounded `{ uint32_t len; char data[N]; }`
- `bytes<N>` → inline bounded `{ uint32_t len; uint8_t data[N]; }`
- `cap_descriptor` → `bharat_cap_wire_t`

### Important limitation

The parser accepts field text for many additional spellings found in repository IDLs (for example `uint32`, `int32`, `bool`), but **C code generation in `bidlc.py` only supports the type list above**. Unsupported types will fail with `Unknown type` during generation.

---

## 5. Metadata Blocks and Method Attributes

IDL files in the repo often include per-RPC metadata such as:

```idl
qos = reliable;
timeout_ms = 100;
idempotent = true;
auth = required;
criticality = rt_ctl;
```

This metadata is currently useful as declarative documentation and policy intent, and is now explicitly parsed and retained in the AST. The parser strictly enforces the grammar of these metadata fields but current `bidlc.py` codegen does **not** yet convert these keys into generated enforcement logic.

The strict metadata grammar currently supports exactly these properties:
- `qos = <identifier>;`
- `timeout_ms = <integer>;`
- `idempotent = true|false;`
- `auth = <identifier>;`
- `criticality = <identifier>;`

Unknown metadata fields will cause a parser error.

---

## 6. ABI Compatibility Rules (Current CI Contract)

The compatibility checker enforces these stability rules for baseline vs current IDL:

- Service removal is forbidden.
- Service ID changes are forbidden.
- RPC list is append-only (no delete/reorder/rename/signature change in existing prefix).
- Message/struct fields are append-only (no delete/reorder/rename/type-change in existing prefix).
- Enums cannot remove members or change existing numeric values.

When evolving contracts, treat existing declaration order as stable ABI.

---

## 7. Example (Safe Profile)

```idl
service bharat.monitor.v1 = 1 {
  rpc Heartbeat(HeartbeatReq) -> HeartbeatResp {
    qos = reliable;
    timeout_ms = 100;
    idempotent = true;
    criticality = rt_ctl;
  }

  rpc NodeJoin(NodeJoinReq) -> NodeJoinResp {
    qos = reliable;
    timeout_ms = 500;
    auth = required;
    criticality = rt_ctl;
  }
}

message HeartbeatReq {
  u32 node_id;
  u64 monotonic_time_ns;
  u32 health_flags;
}

message HeartbeatResp {
  u32 accepted;
}

message NodeJoinReq {
  u32 protocol_version;
  u32 arch;
  u64 boot_nonce;
  string<64> node_name;
  bytes<128> topology_digest;
}

message NodeJoinResp {
  u32 accepted;
  u32 assigned_node_id;
  u64 session_nonce;
}
```

## 8. Relationship to Broader BIDL Docs

For future-direction language design (annotations, richer type system, transport semantics), see:

- `docs/architecture/contracts/bidl-language-spec.md`
- `docs/architecture/contracts/bidl-runtime-mapping.md`
- `docs/architecture/contracts/bidl-versioning-policy.md`

Those documents describe target-state architecture. This `bidl-v1.md` describes the **currently implemented subset and constraints**.
