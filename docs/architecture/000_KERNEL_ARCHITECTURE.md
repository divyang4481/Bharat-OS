Operating systems are strange beasts. They sit between **physics and abstraction**. On one side: electrons, buses, cache lines, interrupts. On the other: files, processes, sockets, GUIs. A good kernel architecture document is essentially a **map of that borderland**.

For a serious OS repository like **Bharat-OS**, three documents anchor the project:

• the **architecture map** (how the kernel is built)
• the **hardware support map** (what machines it runs on)
• the **research direction** (where the kernel should evolve)

Below are production-ready versions of those files.

# Bharat-OS Kernel Architecture

## Overview

Bharat-OS is designed as a **modular, hardware-aware operating system kernel** capable of running on devices ranging from small embedded systems to large datacenter servers.

The architecture emphasizes:

- portability across CPU architectures
- modular subsystem design
- deterministic performance for real-time systems
- efficient hardware utilization

The kernel must operate efficiently on:

- embedded devices
- robotics systems
- drones
- automotive platforms
- networking appliances
- desktops and workstations
- datacenter infrastructure

# Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The HAL isolates architecture-specific hardware logic from the rest of the kernel.

Responsibilities include:

- interrupt controller configuration
- timer management
- CPU feature detection
- memory initialization
- low-level device interaction

Example:

```
corecore/hal/x86_64/apic.c
corecore/hal/arm64/gic.c
corecore/hal/riscv64/plic.c
```

# CPU Management

CPU subsystem handles:

- multi-core initialization
- CPU topology discovery
- SIMD/vector feature detection
- per-CPU data structures

Optimizations include:

- cache-line alignment
- NUMA awareness
- TLB tagging using ASIDs or PCIDs

---

# Memory Management

The memory subsystem is designed around a **3-plane Distributed VM Architecture** (see [ADR 008](../adr/008-distributed-vm-monitor-and-vm-spaces.md)) to natively support multikernel execution, diverse hardware profiles, and real-time constraints:

1. **Plane A — Canonical Distributed VM Model (`vm_space_t`)**: This plane is the source of truth. It manages address spaces, mappings, capabilities, sharing rules, and generations. It explicitly tracks timing classes (Best-Effort, Soft RT, Hard RT) and hardware profiles (MMU, MPU, MMU+DMA isolation).
2. **Plane B — URPC Monitor Protocol**: The distributed control plane. It propagates map/unmap/protect requests, handles remote invalidation (TLB shootdowns), and manages activation hints for thread migration across cores.
3. **Plane C — Local Hardware Realization (`arch_vm_ops_t`)**: The silicon-facing data plane. Each core locally executes page-table writes, CR3/TTBR/satp activation, local TLB invalidation, and page-fault decoding.

The memory subsystem handles:

- physical page allocation (PMM)
- canonical distributed virtual memory (`vm_space_t`)
- local page table realization
- kernel heap and slab allocation
- distributed memory coherence
- user memory and device DMA isolation

Features include:

- huge page support
- URPC-based remote TLB invalidation
- strict generation-based coherence for revocation
- NUMA memory allocation
- cache-aware allocation
- MPU/PMP fallback for hard-real-time and low-end systems

# Multikernel State Management

Bharat-OS embraces the multikernel architecture model (inspired by Barrelfish). Rather than a single shared-state monolith, the system is designed as a distributed system of independent cores to maximize scalability and eliminate lock contention. For an in-depth look at how execution units and scheduling are managed in this model, see the [Process & Scheduler Architecture](core/process-scheduler-architecture.md).

Features include:

- **Per-CPU State (`cpu_local_t`)**: Each core maintains its own isolated runqueue, capability table, physical memory manager shard, and URPC endpoint configurations. Bharat-OS currently uses a hybrid transitional model. Per-core ownership exists for core-local execution state, but global registries still remain for some kernel objects such as thread/process pools. The roadmap target is monitor-mediated per-core ownership and migration.
- **Monitor Process**: A privileged monitor runs on every core. It acts as the local agent for cross-core coordination, handling URPC messages for memory mapping requests, capability revocations, and lifecycle events.
- **Dynamic URPC Binding**: Inter-core IPC channels are established dynamically. A core discovers another through the topology and binds a lockless ring buffer using `URPC_BIND_REQ` and `URPC_BIND_ACK` protocols.
- **System Knowledge Base (SKB)**: Hardware topology (NUMA nodes, L3 caches) is discovered during boot and registered in the SKB. The SKB router uses this topology to pick the optimal interconnect transport mechanism (e.g., pure shared memory URPC for co-located L3 caches vs IPI-assisted for remote NUMA nodes).
- **Message-Based Synchronization**: Critical operations like Capability Revocation and TLB Shootdowns are performed asynchronously using URPC broadcasts and acknowledgments (`URPC_TLB_INVAL`), avoiding expensive inter-processor interrupts with heavy spinlocks.

# Scheduler

The scheduler manages CPU time across tasks.

### Sovereign Owner-Local Execution Model and Real-Time (RT) Context
In accordance with Bharat-OS's distributed ownership model, the scheduler implements a **Sovereign Owner-Local Execution Model**. This architecture physically decouples stable thread identity (`bh_thread_t`) on the home core (the identity authority) from core-local mutable scheduling state (`sched_entity_t`).

For Real-Time (RT) compliance, this model inherently eliminates cross-core lock contention and cache bouncing on scheduling hot paths. RT priority queues, deadline monitoring, and context switching operate entirely on core-local, strictly-bounded structures, satisfying the bounded latency requirement of hard RT and mixed-critical systems.

*   **Stable Thread Identity (`bh_thread_t`)**: Associated permanently with the TID's home CPU and stable forever.
*   **Owner-Local Execution Entity (`sched_entity_t`)**: Stored strictly within the active CPU's sovereign scheduling pool. All queue operations, CFS tree insertions, deadlines, priority updates, and context switches manipulate this local entity.
*   **Per-CPU Structures for RT Isolation**: Runqueues (`sched_rq_t`), capability namespaces (`capability_table_t`), and object pools are instantiated strictly per-core. In an RT mode (e.g., `PROFILE_KERNEL_RT`), CPU partitions ensure strict isolation where specific cores may act entirely tickless while processing purely local, RT-bound tasks, without perturbation from generic-purpose workloads.
*   **Five-Phase Transactional Migration**: Migration is executed using a five-phase transaction protocol (`RESERVE → FREEZE → STAGE → OWNER_COMMIT → ACTIVATE → RETIRE`) with CAS-like verification on the home CPU and reliable, slot-designated completion cells.

For detailed design decisions, state transitions, and idempotency guarantees, see [ADR-016: Owner-Local Scheduler Entities and Five-Phase Transactional Migration](../adr/ADR-016-owner-local-scheduler-entities.md).

# Diagnostics and Reliability

Bharat-OS includes a robust and structured diagnostic system to capture state during critical faults:

- **Structured Panic Context (`panic_context_t`)**: When a kernel panic occurs, the system generates a structured payload capturing the fault address, instruction pointer, stack pointer, core ID, thread ID, process ID, last system call, and the architecture-specific trap frame.
- **Fault Breadcrumbs**: To aid in debugging complex state transitions, the kernel maintains a ring of breadcrumbs (e.g., the last executed system call number) which are attached to the panic context.
- **PStore Persistent Recovery Logging**: Critical diagnostic information is written to a designated persistent storage (PStore) memory region before the system halts or reboots. This allows post-mortem analysis of the crash reason even after a hard reset.
- **Architecture State Dumps**: Architecture-specific implementations dump detailed hardware states (e.g., segment registers, control registers) to the serial console and logs before halting.

- capability-based security models
- trusted execution support

A repository with these three documents tells contributors:

“this is not just code — this is a **kernel architecture project**.”

If you want, the next useful document for Bharat-OS would be **`ROADMAP.md`**, which lays out the **step-by-step evolution of the kernel from bootloader → multitasking → networking → GUI → distributed systems**. That roadmap becomes the north star of the whole project.
